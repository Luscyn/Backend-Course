MERN Stack Learning Journey
I am learning the MERN stack as quickly as possible. This repository holds my notes and code from a JavaScript fundamentals YouTube tutorial.

Course Content
This repository follows a comprehensive backend development course that covers everything from the basics of how the internet works to building and deploying complex applications. The course is divided into four chapters:

Chapter 1: Theory

Introduction to the full stack, front end, and back end.

Understanding how the internet works, including network requests, IP addresses, and servers.

Chapter 2: Basic Backend Project

Setting up a development environment with Node.js, npm, and Visual Studio Code.

Building a simple backend server using Express.js.

Handling routes, requests, and responses.

Using a client emulator to test API endpoints.

Chapter 3: NodeJS SQLite Project

Building a more advanced backend application with a structured project directory.

Using SQLite as a lightweight database.

Implementing user authentication with JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

Creating a full stack to-do application.

Chapter 4: Final Project

Upgrading the application to use a PostgreSQL database.

Using Prisma as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) to interact with the database.

Containerizing the application with Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

Getting Started
To get started with the projects in this repository, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js

Docker

Once you have the prerequisites installed, you can clone the repository and navigate to the project you want to run. For example, to run the final project in Chapter 4, you would follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>

Navigate to the project directory:
cd chapter4

Install the dependencies:
npm install

Build and run the Docker containers:
docker-compose up --build

This will start the application, and you can access it in your browser at http://localhost:5003.
